    <p>It’s a very interesting case: Bombardier has been heavily subsidized already by the Canadian government and sold their planes under cost, which I believe was the source of Boeing’s complaint: Are you against anti-dumping legislation? I don’t know that this is a good case study in the practice, but usually we’re wary of these kinds of pricing policies out of fear of monopolization. It’s a bit of a bitter pill if we’re just trading one crony for another, albeit a much smaller one.</p>
